/*Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence. For example, multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. This means that in the expression 10 + 5 * 2, the multiplication 5 * 2 will be evaluated first, resulting in 10 + 10, and then the addition will be performed, yielding 20.
